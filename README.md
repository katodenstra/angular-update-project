# Angular Task Management Demo

This project was built with **Angular** to showcase my skills as a UX Engineer with a strong frontend focus.  
It demonstrates my ability to create reusable components, manage state, and handle user tasks within an Angular environment.

**Note:** This project is focused on **Angular knowledge and accessibility implementation**, rather than advanced UX design.  
The styling is minimal (basic CSS) â€” the goal is to highlight Angular component logic, structure, functionality, and accessible practices.

Originally styled with plain CSS, the project was migrated to SCSS and refactored to use design tokens.
This makes the UI more maintainable and demonstrates modern design-system practices.
